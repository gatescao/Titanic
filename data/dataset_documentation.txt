data/unprocessed:

train.csv - A dataset provided by Kaggle. We used this dataset to train and cross-validate our models locally.
test.csv - Another dataset provided by Kaggle. This dataset does not contain data on survival, which is withheld by Kaggle. Kaggle uses this dataset to rank competitors.

The above two datasets can be obtained from: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data
